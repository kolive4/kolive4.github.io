Hi there! I am a fourth year Marine Biology PhD student at the [University of Maine](https://https://umaine.edu/) based at [Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences](https://www.bigelow.org/). At the University of Maine I am a member of the [Brady Lab](https://umaine.edu/bradylab/), and at Bigelow I am a part of the [Tandy Center for Ocean Forecasting](https://www.bigelow.org/services/ocean-forecasting/). 

My work lays the groundwork for using environmental DNA (skin cells, fecal matter, mucus, and other genetic material shed into the enviroment) as a detection method for white sharks in the Gulf of Maine. Using these detections, along with other occurrence points, I hope to develop presence-only models and forecasts that can help us infer where preferred white shark habitat may be under future climate scenarios in the Gulf of Maine. This research will hopefully inform the public, researchers, and managers on the impacts of an apex predator shifting its distribution, as well as understanding what is driving these shifts, and how we can interpret the models I create.

Prior to my PhD work, I was a [Chancellor's Science Scholar](https://chancellorssciencescholars.unc.edu/) undergraduate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. At UNC, I was an undergraduate researcher in the [Castillo Coral Ecophysiology Lab](https://castillolab.web.unc.edu/). While with the Castillo Lab, I completed an honors thesis analyzing how coral skeletal structures changed while being exposed to different ocean climate conditions.
